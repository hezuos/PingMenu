h2. tl;dr

Adds a status menu to the OS X menu bar showing the current ping time to google.com

h2. Why did you make this

Was sitting on a train tethering, the connection was going in and out, I wanted to see at a glance the status of the connection. I now use this whenever I'm on a flaky connection.

h2. What does it do

It sends a ping to google.com every 5 seconds:
* If the ping failed, changes the menu text color to red
* If the ping is taking more than 100ms longer than the last one, menu text color turns yellow
* When the ping succeeds, change menu color to black and show the ping time.

Also shows some stats if you select the menu.

h2. What does it not do, but I plan to add at some point (especially if you bug me about it)
* Maybe attempt DNS lookups to test the DNS server
